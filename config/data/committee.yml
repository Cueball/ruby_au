    After a few years as a park ranger and then a few more as a high school teacher, Caitlin has now made the transition into tech. She is currently an intern with Two Red Kites in Brisbane and recently started the [Brisbane Tech Newbies meet up group](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Tech-Newbies/).

    Late last millenium Sharon completed a computer degree because her mum, in the mid-80s, said, ‚ÄúThere is a future in computers.‚Äù Mum may have been right but Sharon went for a wander through academia and the arts ending up as a Film Projectionist. When Sharon was replaced by a digital projector, she took irony firmly in hand and decided, in June 2016, to become a Developer. Sharon now works at Envato.
