      <h3>Sharon Vaughan</h3>
      <p class="position">General Member</p>
    </header>

    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        Late last millenium Sharon completed a computer degree because her mum, in the mid-80s, said, ‚ÄúThere is a future in computers.‚Äù
        Mum may have been right but Sharon went for a wander through academia and the arts ending up as a Film Projectionist. When Sharon was replaced by a digital projector, she took irony firmly in hand and decided, in June 2016, to become a Developer. Sharon now works at Envato.
