<h1>2019 Ruby Australia Developer Survey</h1>

<blockquote>
  The founding purpose of Ruby Australia is to further the use and adoption of the Ruby programming language in
  Australia, and to support and encourage a vibrant community around the language and related technologies.
</blockquote>

<p>
  To support our efforts in promoting Ruby to both developers and potential employers of developers we need to build our
  case on a strong foundation of data. How many Ruby developers are there in Australia? How many potential employers are
  in the market? What depth of experience exists in the community right now? Where do Ruby developers even live? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc97UNFyVTgAzk-amFwYQ2V1bumEYXuDw9GDMCpRCrQsgXG9g/viewform" target="_blank">This
  survey</a> is designed to help us answer those questions and more to the wide variety of people who can help us drive
  further adoption of Ruby.
