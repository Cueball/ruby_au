[reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com) build and support Ruby on Rails apps for web and mobile that return real value for our clients. This focus drives our entire company and we are proud to be Australiaâ€™s largest Ruby on Rails focused development shop, with a client list including some of the most well-known names in Australia. Headquartered in Sydney with our fulltime team in Australia, New Zealand and overseas in the USA and the Americas, we are a 100% remote work company. To ensure that our developers are performing at their best, our team is allowed eight hours a week to get up to speed with new development practices, contribute to open-source work, and share their knowledge.

Our founder, Mikel Lindsaar, is a member of the Ruby on Rails commit team and one of the top Ruby on Rails contributors worldwide. With a passion for growing the community, we have introduced over 1400 new developers to the language through our free community training initiative [InstallFest](https://reinteractive.com/community/installfest). Aside from this work, and our sponsorship of Ruby AU, we are proud to be the only Ruby-level sponsor of [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/).
