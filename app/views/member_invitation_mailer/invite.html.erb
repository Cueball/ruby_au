Confirm your membership with Ruby Australia.

<p>Hi <%= @imported_member.full_name %>,</p>

<p>We're just getting in touch to confirm if you wish to continue being a member of Ruby Australia (and we want to reassure you that this is a once-off email, unless you attend another one of our events in the future).</p>

<h2>What is Ruby Australia?</h2>

<p>Ruby Australia is the organisation behind many Ruby-related events across Australia, including Rails Camps, RubyConf AU, RailsGirls, and monthly meets in many cities. We provide financial and logistical support to event organisers, and seek to grow and improve the Ruby community across the country.</p>

<h2>Why am I receiving this email?</h2>

<p>We at Ruby Australia are in the process of validating our records of members, and we're keen to confirm people's interest in being a member.</p>

<p>According to our records, you have attended the following recent events, which has given you implicit membership of Ruby Australia:</p>

<ul>
  <% @imported_member.data["sources"].each do |source| %>
    <li><%= source %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to continue being a member of Ruby Australia (it doesn't cost anything!), we need to confirm your details for our records:</p>

<p class="button"><%= link_to "Confirm Membership", invitation_url(@imported_member.token) %></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What does being a member mean?</h2>

<p>As a confirmed member, you get to attend and vote at our general meetings, and be nominated (by yourself or others) for a position in the association's committee.</p>

<p>We will also send you very occasional emails related to the association (perhaps a handful each year).</p>

<h2>What if I don't want to be a member?</h2>

<p>If you do not confirm your membership (using the above link), you will no longer be considered a member of Ruby Australia. You do not need to be a member to attend any of our events, though by attending you are agreeing to behave in accordance with our <%= link_to "Code of Conduct", page_url("code-of-conduct") %>.</p>

<p>If you plan to attend any future events, you can avoid being sent additional membership invitation emails related to those events by <%= link_to "unsubscribing", unsubscribe_invitation_url(@imported_member.token) %>. If you change your mind at any point, you're able to <%= link_to "sign up as a member", new_user_registration_url %> on our website without needing to attend any events.</p>
