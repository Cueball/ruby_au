    <h2>What does it mean to be a member?</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    As a member, you can choose to do as much or as little as you want to, it's up to you!
  </p>

  <p>
    Membership gives you voting rights at general meetings and the ability to run for committee
    positions. We will notify you by email of upcoming general meetings and you will have the
    opportunity to add items to the meetingâ€™s agenda.

    <h2>Mailing List</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    If you signed up to our mailing list, you'll be notified of any upcoming major Ruby Australia
    events -- such as Rails Camps and RubyConf. We'll also very occassionally send updates regarding
    the goings on of Ruby Australia as a whole. We are committed to being light on these and you can
    opt-out of them at any time.

    <h2>The legals</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    The Constitution outlines how the Ruby Australia organisation runs, and covers in more detail
    what your rights are as a member of the Ruby Australia organisation.
    <a href='/constitution'>You can view the current version of the Ruby Australia
      Constitution here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    By law, members are entitled to inspect the member registry upon request. The purpose of this is
    to empower the membership to coordinate with each other irrespective of the committee. We expect
    this to be a very rare occurrence, with plenty of avenues for communication between members
    outside of this allowance. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where we are obligated to share
    your name and email with other members, and we suggest you choose your signup email with this in
    mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ruby Australia also has a <a href='/code-of-conduct'>Code of Conduct</a> which
    members are required to follow.
